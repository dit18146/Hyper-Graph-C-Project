# Hyper-Graph-CSharp-Project

Created By [Papachristou Ioannis](https://github.com/dit18146)

## Description

An application for demonstration purposes, which implements a Hyper Graph using **C#**. The Hyper Graph is a multi-use data structure, that can be turned into a Tree, a Directed Graph, or an Undirected Graph.  
  
* In order to visualize the data structures created, **GraphViz** was used. The files created by GraphViz can be located in the Bin/Debug folder, either in text format (.dot file) or picture format (.gif file).
  
* Also includes, functions for regular Tree, Directed and Undirected Graph data structures.  

  
This project is meant to be used in the future, as a **Data Structure Conversion API**.
